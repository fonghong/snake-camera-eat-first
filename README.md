🐍 貪食蛇：相機食先 (Snake: Camera Eats First)

"Don't just eat pixels, eat your friends' faces."
「唔只食 Pixel，仲要食朋友個樣！」

A funny, fully responsive web-based Snake game where YOU choose what the snake looks like. Upload any image, and the game transforms it into the snake's body or the food.

這是一個惡搞版的貪食蛇網頁遊戲。你可以上傳任何圖片（朋友的醜照、喜歡的食物、Meme 圖），遊戲會自動將其變成蛇的身體或食物。
